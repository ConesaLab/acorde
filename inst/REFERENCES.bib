abstract = {Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.},

@article{VandenBerge2018,
abstract = {Dropout events in single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) cause many transcripts to go undetected and induce an excess of zero read counts, leading to power issues in differential expression (DE) analysis. This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq.},

abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics provides an opportunity to characterize cell-type-specific transcriptional networks, intercellular signaling pathways and cellular diversity with unprecedented resolution by profiling thousands of cells in a single experiment. However, owing to the unique statistical properties of scRNA-seq data, the optimal measures of association for identifying gene–gene and cell–cell relationships from single-cell transcriptomics remain unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of 17 measures of association for their ability to reconstruct cellular networks, cluster cells of the same type and link cell-type-specific transcriptional programs to disease. Measures of proportionality were consistently among the best-performing methods across datasets and tasks. Our analysis provides data-driven guidance for gene and cell network analysis in single-cell transcriptomics.},

abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

@article{Arzalluz-Luque2021,
abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a highly-regulated post-transcriptional mechanism known to modulate isoform expression within genes and contribute to cell-type identity. However, the extent to which alternative isoforms establish co-expression networks that may relevant in cellular function has not been explored yet. Here, we present acorde, a pipeline that successfully leverages bulk long reads and single-cell data to confidently detect alternative isoform co-expression relationships. To achieve this, we developed and validated percentile correlations, a novel approach that overcomes data sparsity and yields accurate co-expression estimates from single-cell data. Next, acorde uses correlations to cluster co-expressed isoforms into a network, unraveling cell type-specific alternative isoform usage patterns. By selecting same-gene isoforms between these clusters, we subsequently detect and characterize genes with co-differential isoform usage (coDIU) across neural cell types. Finally, we predict functional elements from long read-defined isoforms and provide insight into biological processes, motifs and domains potentially controlled by the coordination of post-transcriptional regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Nervous systems are composed of various cell types, but the extent of cell type diversity is poorly understood. We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell type-specific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties.},
