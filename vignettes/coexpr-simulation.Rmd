# Introduction

In this vignette, we will demonstrate how to introduce co-expression between
features in an already-simulated scRNA-seq dataset. For this, we will first
explain how we originally simulated single-cell data in the [acorde manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29497-w) using the 
[SymSim R package](https://github.com/YosefLab/SymSim), and then describe how 
to introduce and visualize co-expression patterns in the previously simulated
scRNA-seq expression matrix.

# Simulating scRNA-seq data with SymSim

If required, the SymSim R package can be installed
from GitHub as follows (note usage of `build_vignettes = TRUE` to be able to 
access package documentation):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("YosefLab/SymSim", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

Load the SymSim package, acorde and other required dependencies:

```{r, results = "hide"}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(SymSim)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(acorde)
  library(scater)
})
```

First, we simulated true counts for 8 cell types, which requires the generation 
of a tree object detailing the relationships between the cell types (in this case, 
discrete cell types):

```{r}
tree <- pbtree(n = 7, type = "discrete")
plotTree(tree)
```
SymSim implements a two-step simulation, in which true counts are first simulated
to then add technology-specific noise and user-defined biasess that are normally
found on scRNA-seq data. For the first step, we run SymSim with the following 
parameters to generate a dataset containing 1000 total cells and 8000 genes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# true counts
true_counts <- SimulateTrueCounts(ncells_total = 1000, ngenes = 8000, 
                                  min_popsize = 100, i_minpop = 1, 
                                  nevf = 10, n_de_evf = 9, evf_type = "discrete", phyla = tree,
                                  vary = "s", Sigma = 0.25,
                                  gene_effect_prob = 0.5, bimod = 0.4, 
                                  prop_hge = 0.03, mean_hge = 5,
                                  randseed = 123)
```

Next, we run the simulation of observed counts as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
observed_counts <- True2ObservedCounts(true_counts = true_counts$counts, 
                                       meta_cell = true_counts$cell_meta,
                                       protocol = "nonUMI", 
                                       alpha_mean = 0.1, alpha_sd = 0.005, 
                                       lenslope = 0, 
                                       gene_len = rep(1000, nrow(true_counts$counts)), 
                                       depth_mean = 4e6, depth_sd = 1e4)
```

Here, we selected `"nonUMI"` as the simulated protocol to mimic the properties
of the Smart-seq2 dataset used in our study. For a detailed description of the 
rest of the parameters, please see the [SymSim documentation](https://github.com/YosefLab/SymSim).

Finally, we created a `SingleCellExperiment` object for further processing, including
a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to better characterize the data structure and the
variability between cells and cell types:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# feature and cell IDs as metadata
rownames(observed_counts$counts) <- paste0("Feature", seq(1, 8000))
colnames(observed_counts$counts) <- paste0("Cell", seq(1, 1000))
colData <- tibble(Cell = colnames(observed_counts$counts), 
                  Group = paste0("Group", observed_counts$cell_meta$pop))

# create SCE
symsim_sce <- SingleCellExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = observed_counts$counts, 
                logcounts = log2(observed_counts$counts+1)),
  colData = colData)
```


# Introducing co-expression relationships in the simulated dataset

Our co-expression simulation method relies on 
**breaking the cell-type connectivity between features to rearrange them**. 
To perform this rearrangement and build new, synthetic features, we require 
the user to provide **cross-cell type expression patterns**. 
These patterns are qualitative, i.e. just indicate low or 
high expression in a given cell type.

If you started at this point, or you want to reproduce the results in our manuscript, 
load the already-simulated SymSim data object stored within this package:

```{r}
# load data
data("symsim_sce")

# view object
symsim_sce

# cell type IDs and composition
symsim_sce$Group %>% table()

# plot PCA using scater function
plotPCA(symsim_sce, colour_by = "Group")
```

Next, it is required that users build an **expression pattern table**. This
must have a structure where feature-level expression patterns are defined row-wise,
meaning that cell-types are situated in the columns. Note that the number and order
of cell types must be the same as in the simulated dataset. Each row in the 
\code{dataframe} should then include a \code{TRUE} value whenever high expression 
in a given cell type is desired, and \code{FALSE} to select low or no expression 
in that cell type. Here is an example of how to generate this structure:

```{r}
# create cluster patterns
patterns <- tibble(one.a = c(TRUE, rep(FALSE, 7)),
                     one.b = one.a[sample(seq_along(one.a))],
                     one.c = one.b[sample(seq_along(one.b))],
                     one.d = one.c[sample(seq_along(one.c))],
                     one.e = one.d[sample(seq_along(one.d))],
                     two.a = c(rep(TRUE, 2), rep(FALSE, 6)),
                     two.b = two.a[sample(seq_along(two.a))],
                     two.c = two.b[sample(seq_along(two.b))],
                     two.d = two.c[sample(seq_along(two.c))],
                     two.e = two.d[sample(seq_along(two.d))],
                     three.a =  c(rep(TRUE, 3), rep(FALSE, 5)),
                     three.b = three.a[sample(seq_along(three.a))],
                     three.c = three.b[sample(seq_along(three.b))],
                     three.d = three.c[sample(seq_along(three.c))],
                     three.e = three.d[sample(seq_along(three.d))]) %>% t %>% as_tibble()

# show the results
patterns
```

In this example, we have 15 expression patterns, each corresponding to one 
gene cluster. The first pattern, for instance, where only the \code{Group1}
cell type has a \code{TRUE} value, corresponds to genes where there is Group1-specific
expression. Conversely, the last pattern will contain genes that are highly expressed
in cell types \code{Group3}, \code{Group6} and \code{Group8}.

Now, we are ready to run the \code{simulate_coexpression} function in acorde
to generate the selected co-expression patterns in the already-simulated dataset:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
coexpr_results <- simulate_coexpression(symsim_sce,
                                        feature_no = 1400, 
                                        patterns, 
                                        cluster_size = 200)

names(coexpr_results)
```

As a result, we obtain a named list including the expression matrix and the 
feature IDs that go into each of the 15 clusters.

In this function, \code{feature_no} corresponds to the number of highly and lowly 
expressed features that are to be selected to produce clusters, i.e. a total of 
\code{feature_no * 2} features. In this example, we selected to generate 200-feature
clusters. Given that our pattern matrix has 15 patterns, we expect to generate a
new expression matrix with 3000 synthetically co-expressed features:

```{r}
# show expression matrix
coexpr_results$sim_matrix

# show summary of clusters
map_int(coexpr_results$sim_clusters, length)
```


# Visualizing the simulated co-expression patterns

Now, we can use some of the \code{acorde} visualization functions to make sure
that our data contains the specified patterns:

```{r}
# scale the matrix to enhance visualization
coexpr.scaled <- scale_isoforms(coexpr_results$sim_matrix, 
                                isoform_col = "feature")

# create cell-to-cell-type ID table
ct <- colData(symsim_sce) %>% 
  as_tibble %>%
  rename(cell = "Cell", cell_type = "Group")

# compute average-by-cell type cluster patterns
cluster_patterns <- map(coexpr_results$sim_clusters,
                    ~calculate_cluster_profile(coexpr.scaled,
                                               isoform_ids = .,
                                               id_table = ct,
                                               isoform_col = "feature"))

# plot patterns
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

pattern_plots <- map(cluster_patterns,
                     plot_cluster_profile,
                     ct_labels = seq(1, 8))

plot_grid(plotlist = pattern_plots, 
          labels = seq(1, 15), 
          ncol = 3)


```
